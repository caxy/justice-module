Justice.js Module
=================

This module adds [Justice.js](https://github.com/okor/justice) script for displaying web
page performance metrics. Rendering can be restricted by Drupal permissions. Metric 
budgets and other settings can be managed through the Drupal administration UI.

Requirements
------------

You must download the [Justice.js](https://github.com/okor/justice) library and install it
in this module's directory so that the module can include the script from
`justice/build/justice.min.js` relative to the module's directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okor/justice.git
```
